      "Summary: The National Capital Region (NCR; Rāṣṭrīya Rājadhānī Kṣētra) is a planning region centred upon the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi in India. It encompasses Delhi and several districts surrounding it from the states of Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. The NCR and the associated National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB) were created in 1985 to plan the development of the region and to evolve harmonized policies for the control of land-uses and development of infrastructure in the region. Prominent cities of the NCR include Delhi, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurgaon and Noida.\n",
      "The NCR is a rural-urban region, with a population of over 46,069,000 and an urbanisation level of 62.6%. As well as cities and towns, the NCR contains ecologically sensitive areas like the Aravalli ridge, forests, wildlife and bird sanctuaries. The Delhi Extended Urban Agglomeration, a part of the NCR, had an estimated GDP of $370 billion (measured in terms of GDP PPP) in 2015–16.\n",
      "Despite being a part of the NCR, the Government of India's think tank, NITI Aayog, listed the Nuh district of Haryana as the most underdeveloped compared to all of India's 739 districts.\n",

      "Summary: Capital punishment in India is the highest legal penalty for crimes under the country's main substantive penal legislation, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (formerly Indian Penal Code), as well as other laws. Executions are carried out by hanging as the primary method of execution per Section 354(5) of the Criminal Code of Procedure, 1973 is \"Hanging by the neck until dead\", and is imposed only in the 'rarest of cases'.\n",
      "Currently, there are around 539 prisoners on death row in India. The most recent executions in India took place in March 2020, when four of the 2012 Delhi gang rape and murder perpetrators were executed at the Tihar Jail in Delhi.\n",
